# My Scratchpad 

I have a scratchpad that I use for everyday use when doing a project.
I use this to take notes on the job at hand or write down several tasks.
As this is a take home test I think it important to include this as it 
shows my workflow. 

## THOUGHTS

I'm pondering doing this using PORO or using Rails... The former is
winning in my head a the minute.

When spiking something I usually commit THEN rebase afterwards. As
this is a take home test I am going to keep them in to show my workflow.
They can be easily identified with SPIKING in the commit history.
